Clusterfy

Clusterfy extracts songs from a user’s Spotify playlists and applies k-means clustering to group songs based on fundamental features such as tempo and key signature. It then provides a visualization of this data by extracting the first 3 principal components from each song’s features and plotting the songs on a 3D chart. Finally, it recommends a playlist based on these clusters and inserts it into the user's Spotify account. 


How to Use:

1) Start Clusterfy
	- Run the command "python music_clustering.py"

3) Enter User Information into Clusterfy

	- Copy and Paste the OAuth token from the previous step into the text field "Auth Token"
